## cardputer-prozor-remote
Remote for the Prozor 4k HDMI switch (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07JDGBBXF)

Status: Mostly working.  The 2 and 5.1 commands definitely work, and input 1 command works.  Other things have not been adequately tested yet.

### Thanks to:
* Correct codes for the device: https://www.remotecentral.com/cgi-bin/mboard/rc-discrete/thread.cgi?7940
* Converting codes to a useable format for this project: https://github.com/bengtmartensson/IrScrutinizer

### Why make this?
I lost the remote for the device, and without the remote it is impossible to switch it into the 5.1 mode, among other things.  Rather than buy another device just to get the remote, I am using my Cardputer, which I already have.
